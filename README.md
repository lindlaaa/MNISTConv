# MNISTConv
Practice convolutional net for MNIST.

Using PyTorch builtins like dataloader, dataset, sequential conv layers (conv, ReLu, Pool)(which is new to me). 

Looks like this is overfitting, or an extremely network architecture to solve this problem, since accuracy is 100% after 2400 samples.
